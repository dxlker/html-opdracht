        <h1>Guts</h1>
        <p>Guts is the main character in Berserk. He was born from the corpse <br> of his hanged mother
            and raised by a mercenary named Gambino. <br> After joining the Band of the Hawk, led 
            by Griffith, Guts becomes <br> a skilled warrior. The Eclipse, a traumatic event where Griffith <br>
            sacrifices his comrades, leaves Guts seeking revenge. <br> He becomes the Black Swordsman, hunting
            down demonic<br>beings and seeking to destroy Griffith and the God Hand. <br> Guts' journey is one of 
            survival, vengeance, and resilience.</p>
